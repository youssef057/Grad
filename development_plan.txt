# Logistics Management System - Development Plan

## Project Overview
- Name: Logistics Management System
- Architecture: Module-Boundary Architecture (PERN-MB Stack)
- Stack: PostgreSQL, Express.js, React.js, Node.js

## Module Communication Strategy
- Primary: Direct Service Imports for synchronous operations
- Secondary: Event-Based Communication for asynchronous operations

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Project Setup & Foundation
1. Initialize project structure
   - Create package.json for server and client
   - Set up ESLint and Prettier for code standards
   - Create .env files for environment variables

2. Backend foundation
   - Configure Express.js server
   - Set up PostgreSQL connection with Prisma
   - Define database schema
   - Implement authentication middleware
   - Create basic utility functions
   - Set up event bus system for inter-module communication

3. Frontend foundation
   - Set up React application
   - Configure routing
   - Create authentication context
   - Design basic layout components
   - Set up API client

### Phase 2: Core Module Implementation
1. User Management Module
   - Database models for users
   - User authentication and authorization
   - User CRUD operations
   - User permissions system
   - Frontend user management pages

2. Vehicle Management Module
   - Database models for vehicles
   - Vehicle CRUD operations
   - Vehicle maintenance tracking
   - Driver assignment functionality
   - Frontend vehicle management pages

3. Order Management Module
   - Database models for orders
   - Order CRUD operations
   - Order status workflow
   - Order assignment to vehicles/drivers
   - Frontend order management pages
   - Integration with user module

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
1. Route Optimization Module
   - Database models for routes
   - Basic routing algorithm
   - Route CRUD operations
   - Route assignment to vehicles
   - Map visualization
   - Integration with orders and vehicles modules

2. Notification & Tracking Module
   - Database models for notifications
   - Notification generation system
   - Email/SMS integration
   - Real-time updates
   - Frontend notification interface
   - Event listeners for cross-module integration

### Phase 4: Integration & Refinement
1. Cross-module integration
   - Ensure all modules work together seamlessly
   - Implement remaining event listeners
   - Optimize database queries
   - Ensure transaction integrity across modules

2. Frontend polishing
   - Implement responsive design
   - Add data visualization dashboard
   - Optimize component reusability
   - Implement advanced filtering and search

3. Testing
   - Unit tests for each module
   - Integration tests for module interactions
   - End-to-end testing for critical workflows

### Phase 5: Deployment & Documentation
1. Deployment preparation
   - Configure for production environment
   - Set up database migrations
   - Optimize build process

2. Documentation
   - API documentation
   - User manual
   - Developer documentation for each module
   - Module interaction documentation

## Immediate Next Steps

1. Initialize server with npm and install core dependencies
   - Express, cors, helmet, morgan, dotenv, jsonwebtoken
   - Prisma ORM for database access

2. Set up basic Express server
   - Configure middleware
   - Basic error handling
   - Health check endpoint

3. Create Prisma schema
   - Define models for all modules
   - Set up relationships between models
   - Create initial migration

4. Initialize React frontend
   - Set up React with create-react-app or Vite
   - Install core dependencies (React Router, Axios, Material UI)
   - Set up basic project structure

5. Implement basic authentication
   - User registration and login endpoints
   - JWT authentication middleware
   - Frontend login/registration pages

## Module Development Order
1. User Management (foundation for all other modules)
2. Vehicle Management
3. Order Management
4. Route Optimization
5. Notification & Tracking

## Development Guidelines
- Each module should export only what's necessary for other modules
- Use events for asynchronous cross-module communication
- Document all inter-module dependencies
- Add comprehensive comments for complex business logic
- Maintain consistent naming conventions across modules
- Keep each module's code contained within its directory
- Add unit tests for each significant function
