Recommended Module Communication Approach for Your Logistics System
For your logistics management system, I recommend using a hybrid approach combining Direct Service Imports with Event-Based Communication for the following reasons:

Direct Service Imports (Primary Method)
This approach works best for your logistics system because:

Simplicity: It's straightforward to implement and understand, which aligns with your preference for simplicity
Clear Dependencies: Makes the relationships between modules explicit and traceable
Transaction Support: Allows you to maintain database transactions across operations involving multiple modules
Immediate Feedback: Services can immediately validate operations and return errors
Example use cases in your system:

Order creation needs to verify users and vehicle availability
Route planning needs to access order and vehicle information
Vehicle assignment needs to check driver availability
Event-Based Communication (Secondary Method)
This should complement direct service imports for specific scenarios:

Notifications: When an order status changes, emit an event that the notification module listens for
Analytics/Logging: Track important business events without coupling to specific modules
Asynchronous Operations: For operations that should happen but don't need immediate feedback
Example use cases:

When a route is completed, notify customers without blocking the route completion process
When vehicle maintenance is due, create notifications without tight coupling
Implementation Approach
Start with direct service imports for core business logic where immediate feedback is needed
Add a simple event system (Node's EventEmitter is sufficient to start) for notifications and non-critical cross-module updates
Maintain clear documentation of which modules depend on which services to prevent circular dependencies
Why Not the Other Options?
Dependency Injection: Adds complexity that isn't necessary for your scale; would be overkill for the simpler architecture you prefer
Database as Integration Point: Too loose for critical operations where you need immediate validation and error handling
The hybrid approach gives you the best balance of simplicity, explicit control, and loose coupling where appropriate, while maintaining the module independence that you value in your architecture.




Implementation Steps for Each Module
For each module, we'll follow these steps:

Define that module's tables in the Prisma schema
Run migrations to update the database
Create the module's API endpoints and business logic
Test the module thoroughly
Move to the next module
Prisma Migration Commands
For each module, we'll use:

npx prisma migrate dev --name add_[module_name]

This approach allows us to focus on one module at a time while maintaining the independence between modules that's central to our architecture.

Would you like to proceed with implementing the User module's schema first?
